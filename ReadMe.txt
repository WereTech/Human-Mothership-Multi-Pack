To install this mod, unpack the folder (using WinRAR or 7Zip) of the race(s) you want to use and put them in your mods folder. "steamapps\common\Starbound\mods"

All races should have their appropriate shiplocker, fuel hatch, captain chair, teleporter, and SAIL to avoid any mod breaks or incompatibilities.
